title: Ionic Tutorial
---
In this tutorial, you learn how to build a native-like mobile application with  [Ionic]
(http://ionicframework.com/) and [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/). 
You build a Conference application that allows the attendees of a conference to browse through the list of sessions, 
and share information on Facebook. 

## What You Will Learn:

- How to create and build (compile and package) an Ionic project using the CLI (Command Line Interface).

- How to start from one of the Ionic starter apps

- How to build a modern mobile UI using Ionic components such as side menu, cards, action sheets, etc. 

- How to create a service using the Angular resource module (ngResource) to access REST services

- How to use controllers

- How to use routing

- How to login with Facebook, and publish information to your feed


## Requirements

- To complete this workshop, all you need is a code editor, a modern browser, and a connection to the Internet.

- A working knowledge of HTML and JavaScript is assumed, but you don't need to be a JavaScript guru.

>A mobile device or a Mobile SDK is **not** a requirement for this tutorial. However, 
if you want to run the application on an iOS and/or an Android device or emulator, 
you need the iOS SDK and/or the Android SDK installed on your system. If you don't want to install a Mobile SDK, you'll be able to test your application in a browser on your computer.
